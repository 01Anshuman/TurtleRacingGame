# TurtleRacingGame
Here I made a Simple Graphical User Interface Tutle Racing game using Turtle and Tkinter library having the below functionality
- You will be asked for betting on which color turtle will be winning
- Game will be started and you can see the result on your screen



For checking the Code you can refer the file *TurtleRace.py*
\n
or 

if you don't directly want to experience game without running the code on your computer for that i have already attached .exe file just download it to your computer and double click to this you can play the game....
